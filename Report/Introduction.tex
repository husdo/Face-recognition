% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:

% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by

% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter

\IEEEPARstart{N}{owadays} face recognition is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. People are being observed and recorded everywhere: surveillance monitoring, streets, shops, ATMs, social networks and general human-computer interaction\cite{Forensics}.

The human face is one of the most popular
characteristics that can be used in a biometric security system in order to identify or verify a user. The face is an acceptable biometric
modality because it can be captured from a distance, even
without physical contact or permission of the user being identified. Recognition systems based on the human face are used for a wide variety of applications such as law enforcement, due to these benefits\cite{Occlusion&noise}\cite{NYTimes}.Face recognition encounters many issues like: partial occlusion, different angles (pitch, roll, yaw), lightning conditions (e.g. night vision). These problems are addressed and overcome by using a multitude of methods as discussed in this report.
