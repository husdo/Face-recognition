Face Regnition is a complex and popular problem with a large domain of applications and a lot of methods have been developed since the 
2000's. During this project we have used the OpenCV FaceRecognition module to create different Recognizers. We have then developed a graphical user 
interface to train and test the recognizers easily but also to take pictures from the camera and to predict the name of the person in front of the 
it. We have finally created a database of our faces and tested the different methods with it and with official databases. We came to the 
following results. EigenFaces > FisherFaces > LBPH (to be detailed). But more interesting, if we combine the different classifiers and make a 
decision rule based on the result of each classifier we obtain a more robust recongizer.
