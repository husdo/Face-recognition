Face Regnition is a complex and popular problem with a large domain of applications and a lot of methods have been developed since the 
2000's. During this project we have used the OpenCV FaceRecognition module to create different Recognisers. We have then developed a graphical user 
interface to train and test the recognisers easily but also to take pictures from the camera and to predict the name of the person in front of it. Finally, we have created a database of our faces and tested the different methods with it and with open source official databases. We came to the 
following results: between the 3 methods Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces and Local Binary Pattern Histogram, the Fisherfaces method seems to get the best 
results with 90.80\% of good recognition on our database. But more interesting, if we combine the different classifiers and make a decision rule based on the result of all of them we obtain a more robust recogniser with a 97\% recognition rate in total.
