We validated our implementations with our database. It's contains around 15 training and 200 testing pictures about each team member. In the test set in contains one more person (Andris) to test the result for an unknown face.

The average successful classification ratio.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eigen face: 71.65\%
	\item Fisher face: 90.80\%
	\item LBPH: 86.81\%
\end{itemize}

The results shows that the combined classifier has 7\% better result than the fisher faces method. The reason is the usage of the boosting. We combined 3 independent method to achieve a better solution than any of it. An other important difference is that the Fisher and the eigenface method did not use threshold for the decision. Because of that if an unknown face would be tried to classify the method would return one of the known label in any circumstances. The combined classifier result shows that the unknown person (Andris) 73\% classified as not recognizable face.
